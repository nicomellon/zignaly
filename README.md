# Zignaly FE Developer Task

Hey! Thanks for checking out my technical task. I look forward to hearing back from you, Nico.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have the [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed to run this project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nicomellon/zignaly.git
   ```
2. Move into the project directory
   ```sh
   cd zignaly
   ```
3. Build & Run with `docker-compose` (this may take up to a few minutes the first time you build the image)
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```
